                What is a hackathon?              
              </h3>
              <p>
                A hackathon is a 24 hour event where students of different backgrounds come together to collaborate on a project. Teams of up to 4 work together on brainstorming an idea and bringing the technology to life, and may present the project to possibly win some awesome prizes! You can also attend workshops, hear from inspiring speakers, and network with company representatives and fellow hackers.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Can high schoolers attend? 
              </h3>
              <p>
                Yes! However, you must be at least 18 years old at the time of the hackathon to attend. 
              </p>
              <h3>
                What should I bring?            
              </h3>
              <p>
                An open mind, laptop, charger, government-issued ID, toiletries, sleeping bag, and anything else you would need to hack! Note: There will be no showers at the event.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Do I sign up as an individual or as a team?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Individual. We will be accepting applicants on an individual basis. Those accepted can form teams before the hackathon (i.e. via our Slack channel) or during team formation at the start of the hackathon!               </p>
              <h3>
                When are applications released and when are they due?
              </h3>
              <p>
                We will release hacker applications on March 23rd, 2020 and they will be due on April 19, 2020. Volunteer and mentor applications will be released on April 27th, 2020.

                Who can participate?
              </h3>
              <p>
                We hope this event inspires and highlights those identifying as women or non-binary to hack, and we encourage our allies to participate as mentors and volunteers to support! At this time, we are only accepting UCI undergraduate or graduate students and high school students 18 years old and up.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Does this event cost money to attend?
              </h3>
              <p>
                No, the event is free! We will also be providing food and snacks throughout the weekend, as well as swag.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What if I have no experience?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Perfect! We welcome hackers of all experience levels and backgrounds. We will be providing resources and workshops to help new hackers get started on projects and learn new technologies. There will also be mentors at the event to help guide you!
              </p>
              <h3>
                Can I come with a project pre-built or will I have to build from scratch?
              </h3>
              <p>
                You will be building your project from scratch. However, feel free to come with ideas of what you want to build!
